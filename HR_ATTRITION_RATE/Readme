The HR Attrition dataset contains employee-related information, which can be used to analyze patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition (i.e., employees leaving the company). It is often utilized for building predictive models and performing data analysis in the areas of human resources and workforce management. This dataset can help organizations identify trends, causes of attrition, and potential areas for improvement in employee retention strategies.

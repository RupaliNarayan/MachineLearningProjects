# 🧠 Coupon Acceptance Prediction

Predicting whether a user will accept a coupon during their e-commerce journey, based on demographic and behavioral features.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, blindly offering coupons can lead to wasted marketing efforts. This project aims to build a classification model to **predict whether a user will accept a coupon**, thereby helping platforms personalize offers and improve promotional effectiveness.

## 📊 Dataset & Features

The dataset includes user demographics (e.g., age, income), travel patterns, and contextual features such as:

- Destination and direction info
- Time of day
- Occupation and education
- Income level

## 🔧 Process Overview

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values.
- Dropped columns with high null rates or low information.
- Performed one-hot encoding on categorical features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used **countplots** to explore categorical distributions.
- Analyzed **correlations** to remove redundant features like `direction_same` and `direction_opp`.

### 3. Model Building
Tested multiple ML models using `scikit-learn`:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors

### 4. Evaluation
- Logistic Regression achieved the best performance with **~68.7% test accuracy**.
- Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
